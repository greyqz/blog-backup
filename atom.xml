Writing some compositions<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to make full preparations.</p></blockquote><h3 id="i-A-Mail-about-the-Mid-Autumn-Day"><a href="#i-A-Mail-about-the-Mid-Autumn-Day" class="headerlink" title="i) A Mail about the Mid-Autumn Day"></a>i) A Mail about the Mid-Autumn Day</h3><p>Dear John,</p><p>Previously you’d like to learn the Mid-Autumn Day, and you can have a better comprehension through my brief introduction.</p><p>The Mid-Autumn Day is one of the traditions in China which usually holds in September or October. Obviously, the Mid-Autumn Day is also one of the seven most important festivals.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> At this day, people gather together and enjoy the time of the family. After a big meal, all family members come out to admire the full moon in the middle sky. When staring at the moon, people also eat mooncakes, traditional food shaped like a full moon. There are a variety of mooncakes, many of which are tasty and sweet. Watching the moon, eating mooncakes and nuts, talking and laughing, the happy times sweep all the worries and annoyances away. And that is why we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Day as a legal holiday.</p><p>The above is all. I’m looking forward to your earliest reply.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Li Hua</p><h3 id="ii-A-Speech-about-Healthy-Eating-Habits"><a href="#ii-A-Speech-about-Healthy-Eating-Habits" class="headerlink" title="ii) A Speech about Healthy Eating Habits"></a>ii) A Speech about Healthy Eating Habits</h3><p><u>Dear friends,</u></p><p><u>As we all know, we are what we eat. Therefore, it’s very important for us to form healthy eating habits.</u> The following part I’d like to discuss the eating habits.</p><p>Nowadays some students hold an unbalanced diet. They don’t eat breakfast since there is no so much time to eat. They prefer snacks rather than meals and are particular about food. Some of them declare themselves as vegetarian, and some others simply don’t like vegetables. And the worth is that some students are overweight owing to the high intake of trans fats.</p><p>That would be bad if you still persist your unhealthy eating habits. On the contrary, we all need to hold healthy ones. First, we should eat in multi-dimension. Main meals, eggs and milk,  meats and vegetables, whole grains, all kinds of food should be eaten. Second, we should have meals in particular times, for example, 3 times a day. Also, the amount we eat should be controlled at an exact point. Don’t eat too much – it would be damaging to our figure. All in all, do what you think is healthy.</p><p><u>That’s all. Thank you!</u></p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2018/03/29/Compositions-20180329/">https://greyqz.github.io/2018/03/29/Compositions-20180329/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.<div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">The subjects are from 教材完全解读, 高中英语, 必修三, 中国青年出版社 (2015).

    <title>OPINION: Should Tourists Be Required to Buy Through Tickets?</title>

CONFIDENTIAL before the exam.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Should-Tourists-Be-Required-to-Buy-Through-Tickets"><a href="#Should-Tourists-Be-Required-to-Buy-Through-Tickets" class="headerlink" title="Should Tourists Be Required to Buy Through Tickets?"></a>Should Tourists Be Required to Buy Through Tickets?</h3><p>Debating heatedly, we hold a debate competition, concerning tourists should be required to buy through tickets in tourist spots or not. After a little time, we finally reached the agreement. The ideas of this debate concern as follows<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Some competitors agreed with the statement<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> on account of the inconvenience when buying tickets delicately and frequently. Many visitors are facing problems buying tickets one by one, when visiting one tourist spot after another. Through tickets can be a useful way to figure out this problem. Also, through tickets could be used to control the population of tourists since sometimes there are too many people in a certain tourist zone.</p><p>Some others claimed that visitors have to visit spots which they don’t like because of the requirement. These tourist spots are sometimes unplayable, uninteresting or filled with people. And as a matter of fact, some visitors are not so rich on spending triple money, and so they don’t want to visit or play here anymore. They have the rights to do so; if they were leaving, we cannot stay them.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p><p>This is a very interesting topic, and many others expressed their opinions in the debate. From my point of view<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we may not need to require tourists to buy through tickets because of certain social groups. At the same time, we can persuade more and more people for buying through tickets. As a new saying goes (p.s. I made it), money could be raised little by little as if you are hard-working.</p><p>In the end, if you really want to classify my ideas into one side, I prefer the cons.</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/12/23/OPINION-Should-Tourists-Be-Required-to-Buy-Through-Tickets/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/12/23/OPINION-Should-Tourists-Be-Required-to-Buy-Through-Tickets/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.<div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">But I still used &quot;hereinbelow&quot; at the examination room.</span><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></li><li id="fn:2"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">2.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">Haha.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Schindler’s List</em> is one of the most famous films and the top 100 of every film rankings. At first, I was wondering why it could be so popular among watchers until I watched the film<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and the answer came to my ears - the meanings made the film remarkable. </p><p>The film tells a story under the Holocaust during World War II. Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and a Nazi officer, saved thousands of lives by employing them in his factory. The clever businessman earned the money that can be used the entire life, but he spent so much of his money saving Jews and giving them hope and happiness that he went bankrupt in the end. The film really moved me because Oskar Schindler was trying his best to save people’s lives without thinking if his job would be lost or he would be in the prison. He served his life for others. On the other hand, life is the most precious but the easiest to be broken. It means that we should be grateful for our lives and help others in need. And someday when others’ lives are having trouble, we should turn to help so as to save their lives.</p><p>The film <em>Schindler’s List</em> also shows many scenes about how Jews in Poland were dead and what they had been treating in Auschwitz. It was really cruel, and I convinced that all people want equality and justice. We should all hand in hand and create our peaceful world filled with love and joy, and make things better.</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/10/05/Film-Report-Schindler-s-List/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/10/05/Film-Report-Schindler-s-List/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.<div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">Actually, it is Mr Chen that recommend this film to us and of course, as a homework.</span><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></li></ol></div></div></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The busiest and the shortest summer holiday is going to an end. I am worried, since it means a new three-year school life. But life is just like this: she displayed all things that you need to take the responsibilities, and you can’t quit from the beginning. The holiday time is limited, but school days are unlimited.</p><p>This summer holiday I did lots of things.</p><ol><li>I took OI lessons from July 4 to July 25. I learned Dynamic Programming and reviewed Graph algorithms. I also learned some STL structures and some special algorithms. I knew I need to learn more, not only from class but also from the Internet.</li><li>I had a birthday without celebrating. On the day July 28, I didn’t prepare any cakes or gifts. That day is just like any other days. I meant I have grown up. Without celebrating, I found out that day is meaningful and colourful. It’s like a fresh midsummer.</li><li>I paid a visit to my Chinese teacher sw on July 28. She is my Chinese teacher, but she is also my friend. She is wiser than most teachers and I respect her for her opinions and thoughts. She held a broad world view and she loves psychology and philosophy. We almost had a good time in her house. I was overwhelmed by the charm and hospitable of her. That was the happiest time of this summer holiday.</li><li>I continued writing my paper about a research. I took hours to overwrite some sentences and parts that were not so nice. And I used LaTeX system instead of Word software to write my paper. Absolutely, it looks nicer. To do the research, I read lots of documents.</li><li>I kept on reciting words on the word book. I know reciting words is important for senior high English study, so I recited almost every day. (Sometimes I fell asleep when I was reciting, and when I was awakened, it’s the next day.) Until now, I had recited 2500 of 3500 words.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li><li>I participated in a drawing project to make <a href="http://live.bilibili.com/pages/1702/pixel-drawing" target="_blank" rel="external">pixel drawings</a> on a large board. We drew a UOJ logo, a LibreOJ logo and a Codeforces logo. It was fun but it took time.</li><li>I held <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/07/08/H2-Studying-Group-A-New-Journey/">a studying group</a> this summer holiday, but the members are all too lazy to come and too lazy to do homework. So I didn’t continue. But it gave me an experience of holding a studying camp. And it tips me that the road to a higher place is lonely.</li></ol><p>There remain few days. I am going to a new world, a world that will happen lots of things. The senior high is coming! I am going to get a prize for me!</p><p>The game is on.</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/15/Summer-Holiday-Review/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/15/Summer-Holiday-Review/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.<div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Update:</strong> On August 31st, I finally <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/30/I-ve-Recited-All-the-NHEEE-Words/">recited all NCHEE words</a>!

    <title>Dash or Hyphen?</title>
    <link href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/02/Dash-or-Hyphen/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to get confused between the hyphen (-) and the dash (–). This is a quick and simple guide to using them both:</p><h2 id="The-Hyphen"><a href="#The-Hyphen" class="headerlink" title="The Hyphen"></a>The Hyphen</h2><p>Basically, the hyphen is the shorter mark that is often used to link two or more words together. It can sometimes be seen at the end of a line to break up a whole word that won’t fit into the space. For example:</p><blockquote><p>user-friendly | part-time | jump-start | well-known | up-to-date | back-to-back | next-to-last</p></blockquote><p>Note that a hyphen never has spaces on either side.</p><h2 id="The-Dash"><a href="#The-Dash" class="headerlink" title="The Dash"></a>The Dash</h2><p>The Dash is the longer line used as punctuation in sentences – coming in between words (as in this sentence). It can also be used – as here – in pairs. For example:</p><blockquote><p>Paul sang his song terribly – and he thought he was brilliant!</p><p>He’s won the election—granted, there was only a low turnout—but he’s won!</p></blockquote><p>There are actually two types of Dash, the en-dash and the em-dash. The en-dash is the shorter version of the dash, named en-dash as it should be the same length as the letter ‘n’. The en-dash should always have spacing before and after. The first example above uses the en-dash.</p><p>The em-dash is the longer version, named em-dash as it should be the same length as the letter ‘m’. The em-dash should never have spaces before or after it. The second example above uses the em-dash.</p><p>The first version, the en-dash, is the most commonly used form.</p><h2 id="Finding-the-en-dash-on-the-keyboard"><a href="#Finding-the-en-dash-on-the-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Finding the en-dash on the keyboard"></a>Finding the en-dash on the keyboard</h2><p>Only the hyphen appears on keyboards as default. As a result, a lot of people mistakenly use the hyphen instead. Some people use two hyphens to approximate a dash (–).</p><p>On the PC, you can get an en-dash by holding down the ALT key and pressing 0150 on the numeric keypad. <strong>Please note – this only works using the numbers on the numeric keypad on the right of your keyboard, not with the number keys above the letters.</strong></p><p>On the Mac, you can get the en-dash by pressing the option and dash keys simultaneously.</p><p>The HTML value <code>&amp;#8211;</code> can be used to add the en-dash to websites.</p><p>Microsoft Word automatically converts two hyphens into an em-dash (not an en-dash) when you start typing when typed between two words, but to get an en-dash you need to go to insert&gt;symbol&gt; and select either the en-dash or em-dash from the list of symbols.</p><hr><p>Reprint from <a href="http://www.dashhyphen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">DashHyphen.com</a>.</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/02/Dash-or-Hyphen/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/08/02/Dash-or-Hyphen/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.</p>]]></content>

I wonder: how much do you know about Tang poetry?</p><p>To prepare for the next lesson, you can briefly have a view of the culture and history of Tang Dynasty. Furthermore, you can read some Tang poems you like on the Internet to have a general idea of the style of Tang poems. The Tang poetry is a broad domain, and the cultural connotation of Tang poetry will attract you to learn more about Chinese.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three days ago, I asked Lin Xinyi if she was able to go to her favourite senior high school, The No. 1 Middle School of Xiamen(hereinafter called Xiayi). She wanted to go to Xiayi because she believed that Xiayi had better resources in teaching subjects in the social-science-oriented area. She had a plan of her senior high school studying. Thus, I admired her more and more.</p><p>However, the conversation between she and I was not about celebrating. She told me that she ranked over 700 in the city, and ranked 35 in Tong-Xiang area. And she was afraid that she would not able to be admitted because there were only 30 quotas of people to be enrolled by Xiayi this year.</p><p>I still thought she might be able to be admitted because some students might prefer The Double Ten Middle School of Xiamen to Xiayi. Also, The Foreign Language School of Xiamen is not bad for students who master social-science-oriented area.

To be specific, this page is not only a log of what we had done, but also a place to hold feelings, thoughts, and results.</p></blockquote><p>Today, 15 July 2017, is the ending of week 1’s journey. Although we only had 2 days “reading class” and no more, I do feel a sense of success. Thank all members in the Group! You really did a good job!</p><hr><p>These two days we had read two articles from <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz" target="_blank" rel="external">Everybody lies: how Google search reveals our darkest secrets</a> (9 July 2017 news)</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/09/liu-xiaobo-tells-foreign-doctors-he-wants-to-leave-china-for-treatment" target="_blank" rel="external">Activists call on China to release Liu Xiaobo for cancer treatment abroad</a> (9 July 2017 news)</li></ul><p>I told them the second article is from English reporter Tom Phillips who lives in Beijing. Thus we can’t simply criticise or praise the author because the author has its feelings, thoughts and values. Maybe he thought that Liu was truly an absolute activist, and he really respect Liu. We don’t know the background, so we can’t make valuable comments.</p><hr><p>These two naughty girls had a great time at school, and they didn’t carefully read the articles. When I was explaining the meanings of the words and phrases, they said with smile: “We didn’t read the articles!” That is what I thought: “…”</p><p>And now, after 3 days, I guess that they would not touch their homework until the class begins. Humans are sometimes the same!</p><hr><p>In the end, I would like to conclude with this saying:</p><blockquote><p>Genius is nothing but labor and diligence.</p></blockquote><p>See you next week, my friends!</p><hr><p><strong>16 July 2017 addition:</strong> They said the were not “naughty girls”, and they did read the articles. Do you believe them? :)</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/07/15/H2-Week-1-Working-Report/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/07/15/H2-Week-1-Working-Report/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is two days before the great experimental attempt coming. I am going to hold a summer camp for students who want to study and read books in a quiet and calm place. This summer camp can provide a clean and comfortable environment to learn knowledge, especially for senior high study. Learning is a lifelong journey and I want to keep my studying habits until the day that world ends. Thus, I made a plan of H2 Studying Group Summer Camp. I wonder what I can really get in the end.</p><p>For teachers and students in <em>H2 Studying Group</em>, I hope all you want to do for learning can be found in this summer camp. </p><p>The theme song

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am back!!!! It’s so happy to be here. The full exam was crazy, and I don’t know what to say. It seems that I got a bad score, but actually I had put a lot of energy into this. Therefore, I was pretty sad and got a feeling of disappointment. Although I don’t need to push myself so hard, but I just did it and I didn’t feel regretful about this. After all, I am still a study bully from the beginning.</p><p>So, the exam is finished, isn’t it? I had experienced a lot. I made more friends, and got to know more and more knowledge. Studying is a lifelong journey, and I always wonder what tomorrow will happen. I like the new days especially at the “learning term”. There are two old sayings:</p><blockquote><p>There is no royal road to learning.</p><p>Learn and live.</p></blockquote><p>Learning knowledge is my way to relax.</p><p>But 4 days after I will fight with the PE final exam, and I am going to “make it easy”. Yes, just be relax. I won’t spare no efforts. However, I don’t have the ability to pass it.</p><p>The future is more and more exciting and will be hard to go. I would be prepared to go through.</p><p><br><br><strong>Page link:</strong>  <a href="https://greyqz.github.io/2017/05/07/I-am-back-here/">https://greyqz.github.io/2017/05/07/I-am-back-here/</a> .<br>This work is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="external">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License</a>.</p>]]></content>
