<p>Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack of<br>pre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, so that they can snag<br>programmers and UX designers who really stand out.  Instead of spending valuable<br>time validating a particularly promising candidate’s skillset through a<br>protracted series of interviews, it’s often more efficient to simply <strong>give the<br>individual an offer right then and there</strong>.  Internal studies at Google have shown<br>that experienced recruiters can usually tell if a programmer has ‘what it takes’<br>just from how they act at infosessions: the insightful questions they ask, the<br>stickers on their laptop, and how they comport themselves in general.</p>
<p>Here are some of tips for optimizing your infosession performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask questions to get a feel for the company’s culture.  For example, I always<br>start off by asking “do you have a mandatory drug test?”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that the recruiters know you’re passionate about the company by<br>crying.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be that awkward guy who goes up for more pizza while the presenter is<br>providing valuable information about the company’s agile development cycle.<br>Instead, demonstrate your ability to amortize I/O costs via bulk loading:<br>bring a whole box of pizza back to your seat.  Protip: “free swag” t-shirts<br>make great face rags, so grab a handful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay focused by minimizing distractions.  I typically wear my Bose<br>QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones during the presentation.  This way I<br>retain more information from the PowerPoint, which really impresses the<br>recruiters during the networking session.  Follow me on Spotify to check out<br>my special “Let’s Do This Infosession” playlist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Getting invited to the ‘after-infosession’ is critical.  During the networking<br>session, ask the recruiters what hotel they’re staying at, and make sure that<br>they know that you ‘know a guy’.  Without fail, someone will slip a wax-sealed<br>envelope under your door at midnight, the coveted invitation to an another, more<br>exclusive networking event.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these simple tips and brush up on your data structures, you’ll<br>soon be literally <em>drowning</em> in offers, like everyone else.  If these tips don’t<br>work out for you, you probably need to get your MEng.</p>
