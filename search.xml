    <url>%2F2017%2F07%2F23%2FA-Mail-about-Tang-Poetry%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The composition question is from the English Examination Paper of National I in the National Higher Education Entrance Examination 2017. Original question: 假定你是李华，正在教你的英国朋友 Leslie 学习汉语。请你写封邮件告知下次上课的计划。内容包括： （1）时间和地点； （2）内容：学习唐诗； （3）课前准备：简要了解唐朝的历史。 注意： 1.词数100左右； 2.可以适当增加细节，以使行文连贯。 My version:Dear Leslie, How’s everything? I am writing to you with reference to your next Chinese lesson. The next Chinese lesson should be at 8:00 the next Saturday. If you are not available, please write back quickly so that I would have time to reconsider a new plan. Let’s meet in the classroom since it would be opening all week. The topic would be about the Tang poetry, for the reason that I’d like to teach something not so dull and dry. I wonder: how much do you know about Tang poetry? To prepare for the next lesson, you can briefly have a view of the culture and history of Tang Dynasty. Furthermore, you can read some Tang poems you like on the Internet to have a general idea of the style of Tang poems. The Tang poetry is a broad domain, and the cultural connotation of Tang poetry will attract you to learn more about Chinese. Therefore, it will sure help your language perception. All in all, hope you will like the lessons! I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours, Li Hua One possible version:Dear Leslie, How are you? I’m writing to tell you about your next Chinese lesson. We’ll still meet at my school, but not on Saturday as usual, since I’ll have to participate in a sporting activity that day. So let’s make it three o’clock on Sunday afternoon. As you know, in order to acquire a good knowledge of Chinese, you should learn more about Chinese culture and history. Therefore, this time I will introduce Tang Poetry to you, which is of great help in learning Chinese. I advise you to learn about the brief history of the Tang dynasty in advance. It will surely help you in learning the poems. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours, Li Hua]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Here comes the working report of H2 Studying Group during week 2. To be specific, this page is not only a log of what we had done, but also a place to hold feelings, thoughts, and results. The journey of week 2 is over! We are having a great week in the No. 1 Middle School. Hope every member would enjoy the happy time! In this week we did: We had two word quiz. Word quiz is the most convenient way to find out what level we are learning. And I made the quiz in Guo-style, since Ms Guo’s teaching method was deeply influenced me. (How I wanted to take Ms Guo’s after-class lessons during my junior high! Orz Ms Guo.) We had a word expansion lesson. Also in Guo-style :) And no more… (Because these members often take a leave for reasons. What could I do? I am also very despair!) When I was having a class, Teacher Ye giggled all time, talking some words that I couldn’t hear clearly. How silly So in short, we did little. What could I do? I am also very DESPAIR! Feeling simple…]]></content>

    <url>%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2FLin-Xinyi-is-Mastering-Studying%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Three days ago, I asked Lin Xinyi (林心怡) if she was able to go to her favourite senior high school, The No. 1 Middle School of Xiamen(hereinafter called Xiayi). She wanted to go to Xiayi because she believed that Xiayi had better resources in teaching subjects in the social-science-oriented area. She had a plan of her senior high school studying. Thus, I admired her more and more. However, the conversation between she and I was not about celebrating. She told me that she ranked over 700 in the city, and ranked 35 in Tong-Xiang area. And she was afraid that she would not able to be admitted because there were only 30 quotas of people to be enrolled by Xiayi this year. I still thought she might be able to be admitted because some students might prefer The Double Ten Middle School of Xiamen to Xiayi. Also, The Foreign Language School of Xiamen is not bad for students who master social-science-oriented area. All in all, there was no need for her to worry about. Some days later, I will chat with her to find out what schools is she really enrolled by. Wondering :) A funny photo to share:]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[H2: Week 1 Working Report]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F07%2F15%2FH2-Week-1-Working-Report%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Here comes the working report of H2 Studying Group during week 1. To be specific, this page is not only a log of what we had done, but also a place to hold feelings, thoughts, and results. Today, 15 July 2017, is the ending of week 1’s journey. Although we only had 2 days “reading class” and no more, I do feel a sense of success. Thank all members in the Group! You really did a good job! These two days we had read two articles from The Guardian newspaper: Everybody lies: how Google search reveals our darkest secrets (9 July 2017 news) Activists call on China to release Liu Xiaobo for cancer treatment abroad (9 July 2017 news) I told them the second article is from English reporter Tom Phillips who lives in Beijing. Thus we can’t simply criticise or praise the author because the author has its feelings, thoughts and values. Maybe he thought that Liu was truly an absolute activist, and he really respect Liu. We don’t know the background, so we can’t make valuable comments. These two naughty girls had a great time at school, and they didn’t carefully read the articles. When I was explaining the meanings of the words and phrases, they said with smile: “We didn’t read the articles!” That is what I thought: “…” And now, after 3 days, I guess that they would not touch their homework until the class begins. Humans are sometimes the same! In the end, I would like to conclude with this saying: Genius is nothing but labor and diligence. See you next week, my friends! 16 July 2017 addition: They said the were not “naughty girls”, and they did read the articles. Do you believe them? :)]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today is two days before the great experimental attempt coming. I am going to hold a summer camp for students who want to study and read books in a quiet and calm place. This summer camp can provide a clean and comfortable environment to learn knowledge, especially for senior high study. Learning is a lifelong journey and I want to keep my studying habits until the day that world ends. Thus, I made a plan of H2 Studying Group Summer Camp. I wonder what I can really get in the end. For teachers and students in H2 Studying Group, I hope all you want to do for learning can be found in this summer camp. The theme song of H2 Studying Group is The Show by Lenka.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I am back!!!! It’s so happy to be here. The full exam was crazy, and I don’t know what to say. It seems that I got a bad score, but actually I had put a lot of energy into this. Therefore, I was pretty sad and got a feeling of disappointment. Although I don’t need to push myself so hard, but I just did it and I didn’t feel regretful about this. After all, I am still a study bully from the beginning. So, the exam is finished, isn’t it? I had experienced a lot. I made more friends, and got to know more and more knowledge. Studying is a lifelong journey, and I always wonder what tomorrow will happen. I like the new days especially at the “learning term”. There are two old sayings: There is no royal road to learning. Learn and live. Learning knowledge is my way to relax. But 4 days after I will fight with the PE final exam, and I am going to “make it easy”. Yes, just be relax. I won’t spare no efforts. However, I don’t have the ability to pass it. The future is more and more exciting and will be hard to go. I would be prepared to go through.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Original question: 假定你是李华，你的班级决定组织同学们5月30日端午节(the Dragon Boat Festival)一起骑自行车去西湖观看龙舟比赛。请你给外教史密斯先生写封邮件邀请他上午8:00 在学校门口集合，一同前往，感受中国传统文化。 注意： 1.词数100左右； 2.可适当增加细节，以使行文连贯。 Dear Mr Smith: How are you? Are you free these days? Our class is going to hold a Dragon Boat Festival party and enjoy having fun watching Dragon Boat races together. The Dragon Boat Festival this year is on May 30th, and we all expect the most interesting part of the races! Will you come and join us? We sincerely invite you to our great party at 8:00 am at the school gate. We will go to the West Lake by bike and watch the Boat races. Do you know that the Dragon Boat Festival, which is one of the most famous Chinese cultural festivals, has interesting customs not only for watching but also for playing every year? All Chinese make rice dumplings during the festival. These leaf-covered rice dumplings are thrown into the river to memorialize a great poet named Qu Yuan. We also row Dragon Boats for competing in order to remember Qu Yuan’s death. People love Qu Yuan so much that we still celebrate this festival till now. The Boat race is a memory for all Chinese. Mr Smith, we genuinely want you to come. Ride on your bike and see us at the school gate, and you can study more Chinese traditional culture there. There’s always something for everyone to be amazed at this festival and our festival party.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[(My Translation(Damn it! Translating a poem is so hard.). Rose helped a lot.) When the sorghum wine was just vintaged, I returned from the village;Yellow chicks pecking at grain, and grow fatter in the autumn.Ask houseboy to stew chicks, and drink the wine with pleasure;The children were laughing and laughing, pulling my gown clothes.Singing on a sunny day, and seeking drunk, I want to use this to comfort myself;Drunk and danced, competed with the autumn setting sun.Persuading monarchs, I feel painful because the time is not early;At full speed to catch up, began to run along the road away.The stupid woman in Kuaiji Commandery looked down on the poor Zhu Maichen;Now I also leave home to go to Chang’an, go west into the Qin.Face toward the sky, laughing, and go out the door;How could I be a man living for a long time being ordinary? 白酒新熟山中歸，黃雞啄黍秋正肥。呼童烹雞酌白酒，兒女嬉笑牽人衣。高歌取醉欲自慰，起舞落日爭光輝。游說萬乘苦不早，著鞭跨馬涉遠道。會稽愚婦輕買臣，余亦辭家西入秦。仰天大笑出門去，我輩豈是蓬蒿人。 Li Bai 南陵別兒童入京]]></content>

The same story also happens during rush hours in big cities every day. When there is a crowd, people lose their tempers（脾气）easily. What makes polite travelers suddenly forget their manners? One of the causes is a crowded cabin（车厢）. It makes you feel a distance from your sense of self. In other words, you’re no longer yourself. Tiredness also makes travelers lose their self-control. Think about all those traffic jams on the way to a train station, the long line waiting to enter the station and the busy phone calls from family, friends and workmates. When travelers finally get on the train, their patience has already run out. Besides, a lack（缺乏）of sleep gives travelers a temper. If we are forces to get up early, many of us will act much more impatiently. So, how can we make the world a better place when we’re traveling with a big crowd? Try to improve the atmosphere（气氛）. If it’s a flight, the air hostess could stand in front of the cabin, saying things like, “How many of you are going home?” or “Raise your hand if you’ve never been on an airplane before.” What’s more, everyone can be helpful, such as giving the person next to you a smile, offering the seat to a needy person, and saying “It’s OK” if someone steps on your feet.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Although I invited many friends to discuss English with me, but I can hardly find one who really wants to discuss something real. As the saying goes: A man becomes learned by asking questions. Complacency is the enemy of study. That’s sad. But I still hold a firm belief that someone would love to discuss with me. 噫！微斯人，吾誰與歸！Alas! If there is no such person, who can be in the same camp with me?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Isaac Newton Nowadays, there are a lot of websites that are out of China, and most of them are blocked by GFW. Even my blog comment, a.k.a. Disqus, are blocked most of the time. That is a bad thing for people in China who want to access these websites whatever they want to do. As a result, Scientific Surfing has become one of the most important abilities for Chinese wise students. This article tells people how to use automatic VPN-combined free service to access websites such as Google. Here are a few steps. Steps1Download software you’d like below: Turbo VPN on Android phone: Weiyun Link. HideMe Free VPN on PC and Android: Ask me to get them(because Netdisk services don’t allow me to upload them). 2Open and choose the location you like on the location list. And then wait for its loading. 3Enjoy! Recommened: Google Google Scholar Wikipedia Quora TipIf it doesn’t work very well, you may need to give the software more security powers.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[为 g+x (郭家栩) 小姐姐定制的补习班作文. I used simple words to express my attitude. My Past and My FutureLadies and gentlemen, I’m glad to share my opinions about our past few years. As we all know, we are already 15 years old, and it’s the time to say goodbye to all my creative teachers and our talented classmates! We have graduated from school, and most of us have changed: As we can see, three years ago we are young and naïve, and we all held our simple thoughts. But thereafter, we’ve joined our classes, listened to our teachers and enjoyed the feel of being praised. We spray our sweat and spread the joy of learning something new. Our faces have changed, and all of us have been much more beautiful than before, full of young spirit and expectation. And we are mature and outgoing now, however we were shy and didn’t dare to speak out loud. All of these changes are great for us, and our knowledgeable educators and professors have influenced our mind, and touched our hearts. Extremely thankful to the teachers I love: Ms. ZZX. She is not only a nice teacher but also a good friend. It’s time to break up, and I would love to show you my vision about my future. I am admitted to a key high school, and ought to work harder in schoolwork. I’ll read more and more books, and make a plan to travel around the world. I dare so I can change the world; I want so I can make my way to success. I am what I am, so are you! All in all, let’s change the world! It’s a great honor to speak here! Thanks for listening!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The mid-term exam is coming. This exam will be held in 3 weeks and I haven’t been ready for it. It is really cruel for me. I am going to prepare for it more, with less computer work and more reviewing and learning. Actually, I am not worried at it. I worry about a final examination before the mid-term exam. This final exam examines our ability of Personal Education. I am weak, so I am nervous now. Hope it will be fine. Hopefully, I am a clever girl and I know what I can be. So I will finally see the fruit of success. As an old saying goes, Where there is a will, there is a way. I wonder what way I will finally go to in the future.]]></content>
