Hello everyone, glad to meet you!

I am Grey, while my classmates also call me H+ (Hydron in Chemistry). I am a high school student. I am a learner, and I like English and Mathematics. I like enjoying the time studying and solving maths problems together with friends. I like sitting alone, reading all sorts of books. I like listening to soft music, and watching TV dramas.

Learning is the easiest way to make yourself wiser. When you are reading this blog, you can surely learn something that is useful for you. [Diary entries](../categories/Daily/), [language tips](../categories/Language/), [compositions](../categories/Compositions/), [world views and opinions](../categories/World-view/), wish you would be enjoyable! If you want to discuss or are puzzled about a post, you can make comments under the post (or this post), or you can contact me at email (listed at the bottom of this page).

At last, I want to say: feel free to visit my blog!
