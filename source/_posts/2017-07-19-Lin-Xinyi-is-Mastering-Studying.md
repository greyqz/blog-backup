Three days ago, I asked Lin Xinyi if she was able to go to her favourite senior high school, The No. 1 Middle School of Xiamen(hereinafter called Xiayi). She wanted to go to Xiayi because she believed that Xiayi had better resources in teaching subjects in the social-science-oriented area. She had a plan of her senior high school studying. Thus, I admired her more and more.

However, the conversation between she and I was not about celebrating. She told me that she ranked over 700 in the city, and ranked 35 in Tong-Xiang area. And she was afraid that she would not able to be admitted because there were only 30 quotas of people to be enrolled by Xiayi this year.

I still thought she might be able to be admitted because some students might prefer The Double Ten Middle School of Xiamen to Xiayi. Also, The Foreign Language School of Xiamen is not bad for students who master social-science-oriented area. All in all, there was no need for her to worry about.

Some days later, I will chat with her to find out what schools is she really enrolled by. Wondering :)
