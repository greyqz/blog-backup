Although I invited many friends to discuss English with me, but I can hardly find one who really wants to discuss something real. As the saying goes:

Complacency is the enemy of study.
{% endblockquote %}

That's sad. But I still hold a firm belief that someone would love to discuss with me.

噫！微斯人，吾誰與歸！
Alas! If there is no such person, who can be in the same camp with me? *(My translation)*
{% endblockquote %}
