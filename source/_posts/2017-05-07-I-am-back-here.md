I am back!!!! It's so happy to be here. The full exam was crazy, and I don't know what to say. It seems that I got a bad score, but actually I had put a lot of energy into this. Therefore, I was pretty sad and got a feeling of disappointment. Although I don't need to push myself so hard, but I just did it and I didn't feel regretful about this. After all, I am still a study bully from the beginning.

So, the exam is finished, isn't it? I had experienced a lot. I made more friends, and got to know more and more knowledge. Studying is a lifelong journey, and I always wonder what tomorrow will happen. I like the new days especially at the "learning term". There are two old sayings:

> There is no royal road to learning.

> Learn and live.

Learning knowledge is my way to relax.

But 4 days after I will fight with the PE final exam, and I am going to "make it easy". Yes, just be relax. I won't spare no efforts. However, I don't have the ability to pass it.

The future is more and more exciting and will be hard to go. I would be prepared to go through.
