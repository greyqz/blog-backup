The busiest and the shortest summer holiday is going to an end. I am worried, since it means a new three-year school life. But life is just like this: she displayed all things that you need to take the responsibilities, and you can't quit from the beginning. The holiday time is limited, but school days are unlimited.

This summer holiday I did lots of things.

1. I took OI lessons from July 4 to July 25. I learned Dynamic Programming and reviewed Graph algorithms. I also learned some STL structures and some special algorithms. I knew I need to learn more, not only from class but also from the Internet.
2. I had a birthday without celebrating. On the day July 28, I didn't prepare any cakes or gifts. That day is just like any other days. I meant I have grown up. Without celebrating, I found out that day is meaningful and colourful. It's like a fresh midsummer.
3. I paid a visit to my Chinese teacher sw on July 28. She is my Chinese teacher, but she is also my friend. She is wiser than most teachers and I respect her for her opinions and thoughts. She held a broad world view and she loves psychology and philosophy. We almost had a good time in her house. I was overwhelmed by the charm and hospitable of her. That was the happiest time of this summer holiday.
4. I continued writing my paper about a research. I took hours to overwrite some sentences and parts that were not so nice. And I used LaTeX system instead of Word software to write my paper. Absolutely, it looks nicer. To do the research, I read lots of documents.
5. I kept on reciting words on the word book. I know reciting words is important for senior high English study, so I recited almost every day. (Sometimes I fell asleep when I was reciting, and when I was awakened, it's the next day.) Until now, I had recited 2500 of 3500 words.
6. I participated in a drawing project to make pixel drawings on a large board. We drew a UOJ logo, a LibreOJ logo and a Codeforces logo. It was fun but it took time.
7. I held a studying group this summer holiday, but the members are all too lazy to come and too lazy to do homework. So I didn't continue. But it gave me an experience of holding a studying camp. And it tips me that the road to a higher place is lonely.

There remain few days. I am going to a new world, a world that will happen lots of things. The senior high is coming! I am going to get a prize for me!

The game is on.
