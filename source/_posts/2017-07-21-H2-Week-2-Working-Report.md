> Here comes the working report of *H2 Studying Group* during week 2. To be specific, this page is not only a log of what we had done, but also a place to hold feelings, thoughts, and results.

The journey of week 2 is over! We are having a great week in the No. 1 Middle School. Hope every member would enjoy the happy time!

In this week we did:

- We had two word quiz. Word quiz is the most convenient way to find out what level we are learning. And I made the quiz in Guo-style, since Ms Guo's teaching method was deeply influenced me. (How I wanted to take Ms Guo's after-class lessons during my junior high! Orz Ms Guo.)
- We had a word expansion lesson. Also in Guo-style :)
- And no more...  (Because these members often take a leave for reasons. What could I do? I am also very despair!)

When I was having a class, Teacher Ye giggled all time, talking some words that I couldn't hear clearly. How silly ![Huaji](https://swwind.github.io/img/huaji.png)

So in short, we did little. What could I do? I am also very DESPAIR! Feeling simple...
