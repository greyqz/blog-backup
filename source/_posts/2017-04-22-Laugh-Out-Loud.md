{% blockquote Li Bai , 南陵別兒童入京 %}

*(Translated by me[^1]. Helped by Roses.)*

When the sorghum wine was just vintaged, I returned from the village;
Yellow chicks pecking at grain, and grow fatter in the autumn.
Ask houseboy to stew chicks, and drink the wine with pleasure;
The children were laughing and laughing, pulling my gown clothes.
Singing on a sunny day, and seeking drunk, I want to use this to comfort myself;
Drunk and danced, competed with the autumn setting sun.
Persuading monarchs, I feel painful because the time is not early;
At full speed to catch up, began to run along the road away.
The stupid woman in Kuaiji Commandery looked down on the poor Zhu Maichen[^2];
Now I also leave home to go to Chang’an, go west into the Qin.
Face toward the sky, laughing, and go out the door;
How could I be a man living for a long time being ordinary?

白酒新熟山中歸，黃雞啄黍秋正肥。
呼童烹雞酌白酒，兒女嬉笑牽人衣。
高歌取醉欲自慰，起舞落日爭光輝。
游說萬乘苦不早，著鞭跨馬涉遠道。
會稽愚婦輕買臣，余亦辭家西入秦。
仰天大笑出門去，我輩豈是蓬蒿人。

[^1]: Absolutely, translating a poem is so hard...
[^2]: Kuaiji Commandery: 会稽郡. Zhu Maichen: 朱买臣, 西汉会稽郡太守, 位列九卿.  “会稽愚妇” 是指朱买臣的妻子, 据《汉书 · 朱买臣传》记载: 朱买臣早年家贫, 以卖柴为生, 他的妻子见他 40 岁时还仍是个樵夫, 便离他别嫁. 后来朱买臣 50 岁时做了会稽太守, 衣锦归乡, 这前妻悔得吐血, 又想重续旧好, 殊不知覆水难收, 只好悬梁了事.
