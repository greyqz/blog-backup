{% blockquote Li Bai , 南陵別兒童入京 %}

*(My Translation(Damn it! Translating a poem is so hard.). Rose helped a lot.)*

When the sorghum wine was just vintaged, I returned from the village;
Yellow chicks pecking at grain, and grow fatter in the autumn.
Ask houseboy to stew chicks, and drink the wine with pleasure;
The children were laughing and laughing, pulling my gown clothes.
Singing on a sunny day, and seeking drunk, I want to use this to comfort myself;
Drunk and danced, competed with the autumn setting sun.
Persuading monarchs, I feel painful because the time is not early;
At full speed to catch up, began to run along the road away.
The stupid woman in Kuaiji Commandery looked down on the poor Zhu Maichen;
Now I also leave home to go to Chang’an, go west into the Qin.
Face toward the sky, laughing, and go out the door;
How could I be a man living for a long time being ordinary?

白酒新熟山中歸，黃雞啄黍秋正肥。
呼童烹雞酌白酒，兒女嬉笑牽人衣。
高歌取醉欲自慰，起舞落日爭光輝。
游說萬乘苦不早，著鞭跨馬涉遠道。
會稽愚婦輕買臣，余亦辭家西入秦。
仰天大笑出門去，我輩豈是蓬蒿人。
