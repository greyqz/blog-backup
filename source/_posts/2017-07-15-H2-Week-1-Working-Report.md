> Here comes the working report of *H2 Studying Group* during week 1. To be specific, this page is not only a log of what we had done, but also a place to hold feelings, thoughts, and results.

Today, 15 July 2017, is the ending of week 1's journey. Although we only had 2 days "reading class" and no more, I do feel a sense of success. Thank all members in the Group! You really did a good job!

These two days we had read two articles from *The Guardian* newspaper:

- [Everybody lies: how Google search reveals our darkest secrets](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz) (9 July 2017 news)
- [Activists call on China to release Liu Xiaobo for cancer treatment abroad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/09/liu-xiaobo-tells-foreign-doctors-he-wants-to-leave-china-for-treatment) (9 July 2017 news)

I told them the second article is from English reporter Tom Phillips who lives in Beijing. Thus we can't simply criticise or praise the author because the author has its feelings, thoughts and values. Maybe he thought that Liu was truly an absolute activist, and he really respect Liu. We don't know the background, so we can't make valuable comments.

These two naughty girls had a great time at school, and they didn't carefully read the articles. When I was explaining the meanings of the words and phrases, they said with smile: "We didn't read the articles!" That is what I thought: "..."

And now, after 3 days, I guess that they would not touch their homework until the class begins. Humans are sometimes the same!

In the end, I would like to conclude with this saying:

> Genius is nothing but labor and diligence.

See you next week, my friends!

**16 July 2017 addition:** They said the were not "naughty girls", and they did read the articles. Do you believe them? :)
