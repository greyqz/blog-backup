Student versions (from *H2 Studying Group*). (Modified by me, since there was literally many mistakes.)

Original question & my version see here: [post "A Mail about Tang Dynasty"](../2017/07/23/A-Mail-about-Tang-Poetry/).

## Version 1 by yjc:

Dear Leslie,

How's your vacation? I am writing to you to tell you my plan for our next class.

First of all, we will have class at seven next Monday at my school. Remember to be on time!

Next, I made a plan to teach you Tang's poetry since you are interested in Tang's culture. And then I would like to introduce my favorite poet Li Bai to you. I think nothing would be more interesting than reading his poems.

So, what you need to preview is Tang culture. Tang Dynasty is a long period of the golden age of Chinese culture. That's why its poetry was commended for the beauty and the depiction of the reality and is the most famous around the world. You will surely get a strong feeling of satisfaction when you have read it.

In the end, hope you would like the class! See you then!

Yours,

Li Hua

## Version 2 by SG:

Dear Leslie,

How have you been? I am writing to you to remind you that tomorrow we will have a Chinese lesson at 2:00 pm at my school.

Tomorrow I plan to teach you Tang poetry. It is another art carrier of the history and culture of Tang Dynasty. What's more, it's a core of Chinese culture. Therefore, I think you would love to learn these meaningful poems.

And you can preview by looking through the historical background of Tang Dynasty in your leisure time.

Last but not least, remember don't be late for class. See you tomorrow!

Yours,

Li Hua
