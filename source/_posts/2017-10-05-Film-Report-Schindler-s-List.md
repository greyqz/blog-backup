*Schindler's List* is one of the most famous films and the top 100 of every film rankings. At first, I was wondering why it could be so popular among watchers until I watched the film[^1], and the answer came to my ears - the meanings made the film remarkable. 

The film tells a story under the Holocaust during World War II. Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and a Nazi officer, saved thousands of lives by employing them in his factory. The clever businessman earned the money that can be used the entire life, but he spent so much of his money saving Jews and giving them hope and happiness that he went bankrupt in the end. The film really moved me because Oskar Schindler was trying his best to save people's lives without thinking if his job would be lost or he would be in the prison. He served his life for others. On the other hand, life is the most precious but the easiest to be broken. It means that we should be grateful for our lives and help others in need. And someday when others' lives are having trouble, we should turn to help so as to save their lives.

The film *Schindler's List* also shows many scenes about how Jews in Poland were dead and what they had been treating in Auschwitz. It was really cruel, and I convinced that all people want equality and justice. We should all hand in hand and create our peaceful world filled with love and joy, and make things better.
