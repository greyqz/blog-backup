# (2016莆田)

<span style="border-bottom:2px dotted #42B983;">Train stations and airports are crowded, babies are crying, and passengers are arguing. The same story also happens during rush hours in big cities every day.</span> When there is a crowd, people **lose their *tempers***（脾气）easily. What makes polite travelers suddenly **forget their manners**?

One of the causes is a crowded *cabin*（车厢）. It makes you **feel a distance** from your sense of self. In other words, you’re no longer yourself.

*Tiredness* also makes travelers **lose their self-control**. **Think about all those** traffic jams on the way to a train station, the long line waiting to enter the station and the busy phone calls from family, friends and *workmates*. <span style="border-bottom:2px dotted #42B983;">When travelers finally get on the train, their patience has already run out.</span>

Besides, **a lack**（缺乏）**of** sleep **gives travelers a temper**. If we **are forces to** get up early, many of us will ***act much more impatiently***.

So, how can we make the world a better place when we’re traveling with a big crowd? Try to improve the *atmosphere*（气氛）. If it’s a flight, the air *hostess* could stand in front of the cabin, saying things like, “How many of you are going home?” or “Raise your hand if you’ve never been on an airplane before.”

What’s more, everyone can be helpful, such as giving the person next to you a smile, offering the seat to a *needy* person, and saying “It’s OK” if someone ***steps on your feet***.
