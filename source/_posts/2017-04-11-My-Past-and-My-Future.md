# My Past and My Future

Ladies and gentlemen,

I'm glad to share my opinions about our past few years. As we all know, we are already 15 years old, and it's the time to say goodbye to all my creative teachers and our talented classmates! We have graduated from school, and most of us have changed:

As we can see, three years ago we are young and naïve, and we all held our simple thoughts. But thereafter, we've joined our classes, listened to our teachers and enjoyed the feel of being praised. We spray our sweat and spread the joy of learning something new. Our faces have changed, and all of us have been much more beautiful than before, full of young spirit and expectation. And we are mature and outgoing now, however we were shy and didn't dare to speak out loud. All of these changes are great for us, and our knowledgeable educators and professors have influenced our mind, and touched our hearts. Extremely thankful to the teachers I love: Ms Guo[^2]. She is not only a nice teacher but also a good friend.

It's time to break up, and I would love to show you my vision about my future. I am admitted to a key high school, and ought to work harder in schoolwork. I'll read more and more books, and make a plan to travel around the world. I dare so I can change the world; I want so I can make my way to success. I am what I am, so are you!

All in all, let's change the world! It's a great honor to speak here! Thanks for listening!

[^1]: G+x lied to me and she said the composition is not arranged by Guo as a homework. But seriously, can't I recognize her lies? Who else can arrange such topics?
[^2]: It is funny that Ms Guo saw the composition after all. And she said my composition was so long and full of bullshit. (I know!!! She doesn't need to inform me.)
