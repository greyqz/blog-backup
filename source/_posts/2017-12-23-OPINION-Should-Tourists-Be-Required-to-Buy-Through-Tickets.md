### Should Tourists Be Required to Buy Through Tickets?

Debating heatedly, we hold a debate competition, concerning tourists should be required to buy through tickets in tourist spots or not. After a little time, we finally reached the agreement. The ideas of this debate concern as follows[^1].
Some competitors agreed with the statement[^2] on account of the inconvenience when buying tickets delicately and frequently. Many visitors are facing problems buying tickets one by one, when visiting one tourist spot after another. Through tickets can be a useful way to figure out this problem. Also, through tickets could be used to control the population of tourists since sometimes there are too many people in a certain tourist zone.
Some others claimed that visitors have to visit spots which they don’t like because of the requirement. These tourist spots are sometimes unplayable, uninteresting or filled with people. And as a matter of fact, some visitors are not so rich on spending triple money, and so they don’t want to visit or play here anymore. They have the rights to do so; if they were leaving, we cannot stay them.[^4]
This is a very interesting topic, and many others expressed their opinions in the debate. From my point of view[^3], we may not need to require tourists to buy through tickets because of certain social groups. At the same time, we can persuade more and more people for buying through tickets. As a new saying goes (p.s. I made it), money could be raised little by little as if you are hard-working.
In the end, if you really want to classify my ideas into one side, I prefer the cons.

[^2]: Haha. I used this.
[^3]: I changed that... I used "from my personal perspective".
[^4]: I like this sentence.
