Today is two days before the great experimental attempt coming. I am going to hold a summer camp for students who want to study and read books in a quiet and calm place. This summer camp can provide a clean and comfortable environment to learn knowledge, especially for senior high study. Learning is a lifelong journey and I want to keep my studying habits until the day that world ends. Thus, I made a plan of H2 Studying Group Summer Camp. I wonder what I can really get in the end.

For teachers and students in *H2 Studying Group*, I hope all you want to do for learning can be found in this summer camp. 

The theme song of *H2 Studying Group* is *The Show* by Lenka.
