Dear Mr Smith:

How are you? Are you free these days? Our class is going to hold a Dragon Boat Festival party and enjoy having fun watching Dragon Boat races together. The Dragon Boat Festival this year is on May 30th, and we all expect the most interesting part of the races! Will you come and join us?

We **sincerely** invite you to our great party at 8:00 am at the school gate. We will go to the West Lake by bike and watch the Boat races. Do you know that the Dragon Boat Festival, which is one of the most famous Chinese cultural festivals, has interesting customs not only for watching but also for playing every year? All Chinese make rice dumplings during the festival. These leaf-covered rice dumplings are thrown into the river to **memorialize** a great poet named Qu Yuan. We also row Dragon Boats for competing in order to remember Qu Yuan's death. People love Qu Yuan so much that we still celebrate this festival **till now**. The Boat race is a memory for all Chinese.

Mr Smith, we **genuinely** want you to come. Ride on your bike and see us at the school gate, and you can study more Chinese traditional culture there. There's always something for everyone to be **amazed** at this festival and our festival party.

Your student,

Li Hua
