The world is changing... Even lxy's haircut... How cool!

I must say: the world is unstable, and everything is gonna happen. I feel ANXIOUS. I have no choice but to sink into the ocean of knowledge :(

**YY:** The world is changing all the time. Don't fear, but accept it.

**Me:** Alright. Maybe I would love these changes from time to time :)

Lin Xinyi is so adorable... But her haircut is weird. She said she didn't want such short hair. But when cutting her hair, the hand slips... And then, that's what I saw. Poor kid.

I suggested that she and I gather together and talk about the future and the plan. I suggested that we chat on the app every Spring Festival Eve and every summer holiday, talking about something we care about. Plans, decisions, experiences... She is like an idol for me, and I expect she admires me too. So I don't want to lose connection with her so that she and I can gain more.

—— Hope you good luck!

—— You too.

城闕輔三秦，風煙望五津。
與君離別意，同是宦遊人。
海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。
無爲在歧路，兒女共沾巾。
