> **Summer Vacation Homework Book**™ is a creepy book created to drive students crazy. (fake)

### Work 2 (120)

Dear Tom,

I’m glad to receive your letter and thank you for your concern about our students’ security. All pieces of stuff you may concern are listed below.

We students all attach great importance to the awareness of safety, since more and more courses are taught at school about it. We learn how to protect ourselves, seeking help and fighting with the criminals. Besides, security guards are almost everywhere, observing the whole school. Everyone who is regarded as visitor needs to register before stepping in. Only at the school’s Open Day can anyone come in, but still no one can make any trouble without enormous determinations. Anytime when going out and caught in difficulties, teachers round the corner would lend you a hand. In a word, everyone bares security conscious and contributes to the safety of the campus.

We believe a safer school will provide a better learning environment for us students.

Yours, 

Li Hua

Dear Tom,

Sorry for the late response due to the preparation of the mid-term exam, which you know I took seriously. Knowing that you are interested in the volunteering I involved, I am more than pleased to tell you more details about it.

The volunteering work weeks ago is nothing but impressive. I gained much interesting knowledge about giving first-aid treatment. For example, I learned how to stop bleeding from the wound, how to make CPR and how to bandage a cut. An awkward thing was that since there was plenty of time in the course of volunteering, the leader suggested us to try artificial respiration and cardiac massage. After the embarrassment and shyness, my fellow and I finally gave it a try. But to tell the truth, I felt excited after the long kiss.[^1]

I hope that you would enjoy my introduction. If you want further information, please let me know!

Yours,

Li Hua

Dear Tony, 

Sorry to hear that you failed in the last exam. I hope my advice can cheer you up.

First I would recommend you to keep an optimistic mind. Also, believe yourself and face challenges confidently. You’ve got to know that nothing feels better than trying your best. Second, you need to adjust your studying strategy, as well as making a reasonable plan. Seeking an appropriate studying strategy that suits you the most is actually pretty hard, but at least you need to try it. Besides there are plenty of ways to upgrade your score, such as doing previewing, taking notes, etc. I believe you can figure it out yourself, since proactively put your whole soul into studying is better rather than doing nothing.

Those are the tips on my mind now. I’d always be pleased to offer you help, and I do hope you will find these proposals practical.

Yours,

Li Hua

**Should Square Dancing be Forbidden?** [^2]

As a commonly seen phenomenon over the country, square dance is a popular way to exercise. More and more retired people are taking part in the huge contingent of square dance, swinging and waving their hands to catch up with the loud passionate music. That’s pretty good actually.

But some people somehow can’t bother the square dance especially the loud music, came to the Internet to express their biased views, saying that it should be forbidden. What’s more, they set out wild dogs to bite innocent people. I really couldn’t understand what their minds are thinking. If the music is loud, they can communicate with the old, or call the police if there’s no one taking charge. If it is because of the “dancing style”, they need to tolerate and giving more respect, not shouting or scolding. If you give them full respect, they’ll give it to you, too.

In a word, square dancing is a good way to exercise. That’s it. No need to be forbidden.

Hi Worried,

I’m sorry to know that you’re having such a bad time at the moment. I understand you very much because I’d been depressed just like you when I was younger. Don’t be sad, since you’ll finally make it.

As your “friend” on the letter, here I am, giving you advice. The first is to avoid losing your temper, and try to calm down when you get angry. Anger is like a demon that drives you crazy. So next time you encounter something which makes you nothing but angry, keep yourself cool and think about ways to solve it. As William Arthur Ward said, “It is wise to direct your anger towards problems – not people.” And what others do you need to do is to take it easy. Do your normal studies and live your normal life. You’ll soon get it through. 

I would be always pleased to offer you help, as I do hope you can have your day.

Yours,

Jamie
