These days I've been working on reciting English words of senior high. I made a plan of learning 4200[^1] English words. And after a month's hard work, I have fully learned all these NHEEE words. I feel so happy to see the result!

Just as the old saying goes well:

> Everything comes to him who waits.

Excited!

Tomorrow I will see my new classmates and start a new journey of senior high learning. Although there are three years to study, I feel nervous about what the future will be like. I am young and naÃ¯ve and full of childish, but when so many decisions suddenly come to me, I feel so anxious. Decisions are so challenging, and risks cannot be predicted. NHEEE is hard to all candidates, and NOI is hard for most competitors. I can solely console myself with wills and beliefs. There's a saying:

> Where there's a will, there's a way.

I hold my will, and I am walking on the way. Wish me good luck!

[^1]: 4200 = 3500 (from NHEEE) + 700 (addition).
