It’s easy to get confused between the hyphen (-) and the dash (–). This is a quick and simple guide to using them both:

## The Hyphen

Basically, the hyphen is the shorter mark that is often used to link two or more words together. It can sometimes be seen at the end of a line to break up a whole word that won’t fit into the space. For example:

> user-friendly | part-time | jump-start | well-known | up-to-date | back-to-back | next-to-last

Note that a hyphen never has spaces on either side.

## The Dash

The Dash is the longer line used as punctuation in sentences – coming in between words (as in this sentence). It can also be used – as here – in pairs. For example:

> Paul sang his song terribly – and he thought he was brilliant!

> He’s won the election—granted, there was only a low turnout—but he’s won!

There are actually two types of Dash, the en-dash and the em-dash. The en-dash is the shorter version of the dash, named en-dash as it should be the same length as the letter ‘n’. The en-dash should always have spacing before and after. The first example above uses the en-dash.

The em-dash is the longer version, named em-dash as it should be the same length as the letter ‘m’. The em-dash should never have spaces before or after it. The second example above uses the em-dash.

The first version, the en-dash, is the most commonly used form.

## Finding the en-dash on the keyboard

Only the hyphen appears on keyboards as default. As a result, a lot of people mistakenly use the hyphen instead. Some people use two hyphens to approximate a dash (–).

On the PC, you can get an en-dash by holding down the ALT key and pressing 0150 on the numeric keypad. **Please note – this only works using the numbers on the numeric keypad on the right of your keyboard, not with the number keys above the letters.**

On the Mac, you can get the en-dash by pressing the option and dash keys simultaneously.

The HTML value `&#8211;` can be used to add the en-dash to websites.

Microsoft Word automatically converts two hyphens into an em-dash (not an en-dash) when you start typing when typed between two words, but to get an en-dash you need to go to insert>symbol> and select either the en-dash or em-dash from the list of symbols.
