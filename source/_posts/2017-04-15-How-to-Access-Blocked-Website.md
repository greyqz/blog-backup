Nowadays, there are a lot of websites that are out of China, and most of them are blocked by GFW. Even my blog comment, a.k.a. **Disqus**, are blocked most of the time. That is a bad thing for people in China who want to access these websites whatever they want to do. As a result, Scientific Surfing has become one of the most important abilities for Chinese wise students.

This article tells people how to use automatic VPN-combined free service to access websites such as Google. Here are a few steps.

# Steps
## 1

**Download software** you'd like below:

- Turbo VPN on *Android* phone: [Weiyun Link](http://url.cn/47TYzT2).
- HideMe Free VPN on *PC* and *Android*: [Ask me](mailto:greyqz@126.com) to get them(because Netdisk services don't allow me to upload them).

## 2

**Open** and **choose the location** you like on the location list. And then wait for its loading.

## 3
