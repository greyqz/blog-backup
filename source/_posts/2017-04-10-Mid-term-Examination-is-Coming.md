The mid-term exam is coming. This exam will be held in 3 weeks and I haven't been ready for it. It is really cruel for me. I am going to prepare for it more, with less computer work and more reviewing and learning.

Actually, I am not worried at it. I worry about a final examination before the mid-term exam. This final exam examines our ability of Personal Education. I am weak, so I am nervous now. Hope it will be fine.

Hopefully, I am a clever girl and I know what I can be. So I will finally see the fruit of success. As an old saying goes,

> Where there is a will, there is a way.

I wonder what way I will finally go to in the future.
